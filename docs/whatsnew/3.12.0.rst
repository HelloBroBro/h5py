Deprecations
------------

---------------------

* Support for Python 3.8 was dropped. Python 3.9 or newer is now required
  to build or install h5py from this version on.
---------------------

* The minimum supported version of HDF5 was increased to 1.10.6. If you need h5py on
  HDF5 1.10.4 or .5, please use h5py 3.11.
* Fill time for chunked storage was set to ``h5d.FILL_TIME_ALLOC``. Now this
  is handled by HDF5 library where the default is ``h5d.FILL_TIME_IFSET``
  (equivalent to ``fill_time='ifset'``). Please use ``fill_time='alloc'`` if
  the behaviour in previous releases is wanted.

Exposing HDF5 functions
-----------------------

* Expose fill time option in dataset creation property list via the
  ``fill_time`` parameter in ``create_dataset``.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed values of ``H5F_close_degree_t`` enum.
* External links are now accessed with libhdf5's default access properties.
